# Application model GAN network in banner generator
------
### Overview.
My project to talk about banner generator using by GAN model. Model plays an important role generator banner work. The dataset is collected include: text description and image. The dataset have 4095 data about different field such as car adversiting, sofa, .... With the dataset is small then the model generated images is not good. It's evaluated by some FID, PSRN, IS metrics. So in the future I try improve my model.
