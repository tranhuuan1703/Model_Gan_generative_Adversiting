# Application model GAN network in banner generator
------
### Overview.
My project to talk about banner generator using by GAN model. Model plays an important role generator banner work. The dataset is collected include: text description and image. The dataset have 4095 data about different field such as car adversiting, sofa, .... With the dataset is small then the model generated images is not good. It's evaluated by some FID, PSRN, IS metrics. So in the future I try improve my model.
### Description.
#### Images.
The dataset comprises a diverse array of high-resolution images sourced from various domains, including but not limited to natural scenes, objects, and complex visual scenarios. Each image is meticulously annotated to provide context and highlight key features, ensuring a well-rounded representation of visual content
#### Text description.
the textual is the description of each image. The textual using VietNamese language to description image. The text is slogan or title of image... . The text has a relationship with image, It's talk about features in image.
#### Model GAN.
